    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 17, 2025</div>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the CurrencyX web application (the "Service") operated by the CurrencyX Development Team ("us", "we", or "our"). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us and you regarding the subject matter hereof.</p>

    <h2>2. Nature of Service (Not Financial Advice)</h2>
    <p>CurrencyX is a financial tracking and visualization tool. It provides data analysis based on user input, historical trends, and third-party currency exchange APIs. <strong>CurrencyX is NOT a bank, a financial advisor, or an investment platform.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The "AI Forecast" and "Budget Alerts" features are estimates generated by algorithms (Linear Regression and Logic-based rules). We do not guarantee the accuracy of these predictions.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that any reliance on these predictions for actual financial decisions is at your own risk.</li>
        <li>Currency conversion rates are provided by third-party APIs and may have a delay. They should not be used for high-frequency trading or critical financial settlements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. User Accounts & Security</h2>
    <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us with information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password. We utilize industry-standard hashing (Scrypt/SHA-256) to protect credentials, but we cannot guarantee absolute security against unauthorized third-party hacking.</p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service and its original content (excluding Content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of CurrencyX and its licensors. The "Glassmorphism" UI design, the underlying "Hybrid ML" classification algorithms, and the forecasting models are protected by copyright and intellectual property laws.</p>

    <h2>5. User Data & Privacy</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy. By using our Service, you understand and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your financial data (expenses, budgets) is stored in a secured database.</li>
        <li>We do not sell your personal transaction history to third-party advertisers.</li>
        <li>We may use anonymized, aggregated data to improve our Machine Learning models (e.g., teaching the AI that "Uber" is "Transport").</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Limitations</h2>
    <p>The Service utilizes probabilistic Machine Learning models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) to categorize transactions. You acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The AI may occasionally miscategorize transactions (e.g., identifying a "Book Store" as "Food").</li>
        <li>The User retains the right and responsibility to manually edit or correct these entries via the Dashboard history.</li>
        <li>We accept no liability for budget errors caused by miscategorization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall CurrencyX, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content.</p>

    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
